            The drawer changes each round according to the order in the player list. The player list also shows the number of points
            each user has to the right of their username. The current and maximum number of players is displayed at the top of the player list.

              <b>The drawer will be given a prompt that only they can see</b>, and have 90 seconds to draw the prompt on the canvas.
            </p></blockquote>

            Drawers are not allowed to write letters or numbers. In general, drawers should just draw the prompt instead of trying
            to get around restrictions. However, it is acceptable to split compound words into individual words. For example when
            given the prompt "paper boat", one could draw paper, a plus sign, and a boat. Ultimately, the rules are enforced by the
            room host rather than the game. If players disagree with the rules of the host, they are encouraged to host their
            own room.

              <b>Guessers can make guesses in the guess box</b> while the drawer is drawing.
            </p></blockquote>
            All players can see what the guesses are, unless a guess is close to the prompt. If the guess is close to the prompt,
            the person who made that guess will be notified that they are close, and their guess only visible to them and the drawer.
            When the prompt is guessed correctly,
            the drawer and the person who guessed correctly will each get N-1 points, where N is the number of players in the room.
            If there the remaining time of the round was greater than 20 seconds, it will be reduced to 20 seconds. The drawer will receive an
            additional point for each guesser who guesses correctly after the first, and those guessers will receive one point
            less than the person who guessed correctly before them.<br>
            Drawers can pass the round if they do not wish to draw. This cannot be used if someone has already guessed the prompt.
